# 1.0.0

Pair with integration 1.0.0.

- **Version 1.0.** The numbers start again at 1.0.0, after 2.37.1, for the first release published for everyone. No change to the controller.
- **The dashboard the app serves:** no What's new with the first-run tour. No change to the controller.
- **A new icon and logo in Settings → Apps:** a tank of water with a seedling in front of it, white on a blue tile. **The dashboard the app serves** has the same mark in its menu. No change to the controller.

# 2.37.1

Pair with integration 2.37.1.

- **The dashboard the app serves:** the tank chart's times no longer run together in the Overview's side column. No change to the controller.
- **Auto setpoints never moves the rescue level.** It keeps the maintenance trigger at least 3 points over the rescue level instead, and plans a dryback that would end under it only as deep as the rescue lets the zone go; the plan's note says so. **The dashboard the app serves** no longer credits a rescue level change to Auto setpoints. No new options; no change to the state file.
- **The vitals name the peak an overnight dryback is from:** "shot when VWC < 46.64% (now 69.1%), the 45% dryback from the 84.8% peak". **The dashboard the app serves** says it the same way. No new options; no change to the state file.

# 2.37.0

Pair with integration 2.37.0.

- **The dashboard the app serves:** exported plans and recipes are named for what they hold. No change to the controller.
- **The dashboard the app serves:** a room without the solenoids, pump and dosers a refill needs offers no refill, and its Reservoir page shows only the tank's level and minimum. No change to the controller.
- **The dashboard the app serves:** a last batch recorded by an older controller names its nutrients from the stage's recipe. No change to the controller.
- **The dashboard the app serves:** the tank card no longer shows the water's temperature, and Rooms & hardware no longer maps a tank temperature sensor. No change to the controller.
- **64-bit only.** The app is built for amd64 and aarch64; its armv7 (32-bit) build is gone, as Home Assistant has had no 32-bit release since 2025.12 and the app needs 2026.5 or newer. No change to the controller.
- **The dashboard the app serves:** the grow-day chart's line runs on through a stretch where the reading held still, and breaks only where the probe could not be read. No change to the controller.
- **A reminder to refill the reservoir by hand (CS-706).** Without automatic refills, once the reservoir has read at or under the feed plan's `remind_pct` three passes in a row, a notification says how full it is and what is left before its minimum, again each day it stays there, and goes at 5 points above. Its time is kept in the batch record (`reminded_at`); an older state file loads with none up. No new options. **The dashboard the app serves** sets the level, draws it on the tank chart and shows Refill soon.
- **The dashboard the app serves:** a first-run tour, which starts by itself once on a new installation, and from Help → Take the tour at any time. No change to the controller.

# 2.36.0

Pair with integration 2.36.0.

- **The dashboard the app serves:** Rooms & hardware no longer has the catch-test calculator. No change to the controller.
- **The dashboard the app serves:** Rooms & hardware takes pot volume in litres and dripper flow in L/h only. No change to the controller.
- **The dashboard the app serves:** two Nutrifield sizes in the substrate presets. No change to the controller.
- **The dashboard the app serves:** the tank card's level comes only from the reservoir's level sensor; the separate tank level sensor in % is no longer a mapping. No change to the controller.
- **A dose that runs its time gave the recipe's amount.** The time the controller takes to switch a doser no longer counts as more (121 mL for a recipe's 120); a dose stopped sooner still gives its share. The last batch record (`batch_status.last`) gains `doses`, each nutrient in dosing order, and a batch stopped part-way (CS-701) names what it gave by nutrient. **The dashboard the app serves** shows the last batch by nutrient. No new options; an older state file's last batch, without `doses`, still loads.
- **The dashboard the app serves:** on a computer, the Reservoir page puts the doses beside Fill and mix, at the same height as Fill. No change to the controller.

# 2.35.2

Pair with integration 2.35.2.

- **Water per plant in litres to two places.** The vitals notification reads each plant's water in litres to two places from a litre up ("1.26 L/plant day", was "1.3 L/plant day") and in whole mL below it, judged by the mL as shown, so 999.6 mL reads "1.00 L/plant day", not "1000 mL/plant day". **The dashboard the app serves** shows it the same way. No new options; no change to the state file.

# 2.35.1

Pair with integration 2.35.1.

- **The dashboard the app serves:** the Overview's VWC and EC tiles are named for how the zones read their probes, such as Lowest VWC for a room of one zone reading its lowest probe. No change to the controller.

# 2.35.0

Pair with integration 2.35.0.

- **The dashboard the app serves:** a tidier Overview: each zone's grow-day line is its phase and moisture now, with the rest behind Predictions and the chart's key behind a ?, and a zone's last irrigation on one line. No change to the controller.
- **The dashboard the app serves:** the Reservoir page's dosers are small cards, with their note behind a ?. No change to the controller.
- **The dashboard the app serves:** it opens light by default; Settings → Appearance can still follow Home Assistant or stay dark. No change to the controller.
- **The dashboard the app serves:** feed recipes can start from Athena (Chill Division modified) or Front Row 3-2-2 high strength templates, and be exported to and imported from recipe files. No change to the controller.

# 2.34.0

Pair with integration 2.34.0.

- **The nutrients go in while the reservoir fills.** One pause after the pump and recirculation start half-way through the fill, the doses go in while the fresh water still runs; the fresh water stops at the fill's end whatever the step, and recirculation runs to the fill's end and at least `mix_s` after the last dose. A refill stopped mid-dose stops the fresh water too. `batch_status` gains `fill_until`. **The dashboard the app serves** shows the doses inside Fill and mix. No new options; no change to the state file.

# 2.33.1

Pair with integration 2.33.1.

- **The dashboard the app serves:** the tank card charts the reservoir's level over the last 12 or 24 hours, from Home Assistant's recorded history of its level sensor. No change to the controller.
- **The dashboard the app serves:** the tank card's footnote is gone. No change to the controller.

# 2.33.0

Pair with integration 2.33.0.

- **The dashboard the app serves:** the tank card's Refill and Last refill are the controller's own record of the refills it runs (`batch_status`), not two mapped sensors. No change to the controller.

# 2.32.2

Pair with integration 2.32.2.

- **The reservoir's level reads while it holds still.** The 10-minute rule of 2.32.0 (and 2.32.1's template API read of `last_reported`) is removed: Home Assistant's ESPHome integration drops a reading that repeats the last, so a still reservoir's ultrasonic looked silent for hours. The level reads nothing only when Home Assistant has no reading (unavailable, unknown, not a number); an ESPHome `timeout` filter makes a failed ultrasonic report unknown. No new options; no change to the state file.

# 2.32.1

Pair with integration 2.32.1.

- **The reservoir's level reads again while it holds steady.** 2.32.0 judged the level sensor's last report from the REST state's `last_reported`, which Home Assistant does not renew in the JSON it serves while a sensor reports the same value: a level steady for 10 minutes read as nothing (no refill by hand, the next shot not held at the minimum). `ha_reported` now reads it live through the template API; when that can't be told, the reading stands. No new options; no change to the state file.

# 2.32.0

Pair with integration 2.32.0.

- **The dashboard the app serves:** each zone's line on Today's grow day wraps on a laptop too. No change to the controller.
- **A level sensor that stops reporting is not trusted.** The reservoir's level reads as nothing once its sensor's `last_reported` (Home Assistant moves it at every report, the same value or not) is more than 10 minutes old: no refill starts on it, a refill filling stops at the half-way check, and CS-705 follows. No new options; no change to the state file. **The dashboard the app serves** shows the controller's level, or none.
- **The dashboard the app serves:** each feed recipe has its own dosing order, set by dragging its rows; doses show whole mL, with what 1 part is. The controller doses in the feed plan's order, as before, and the plan's doses are now whole mL. No change to the controller.
- **The dashboard the app serves:** a feed schedule by week on the Reservoir page. The integration moves the feed plan's stage on as each week starts; the controller doses the plan's stage, as before. No change to the controller.
- **The dashboard the app serves:** stock tanks are their name, capacity, level, low mark and doser; what a batch takes is the recipe's. No change to the controller: the integration draws each tank by what its doser gave in the batches the controller reports.

# 2.31.0

Pair with integration 2.31.0.

- **The reservoir never runs dry.** With the reservoir's distances when full and empty set (Feed → Reservoir), the controller reads its level as a percentage and keeps it above its minimum (5% unless changed): it plans a refill from the room's next round of shots (`next_shot_size`), starts one between shots with automatic refills on, holds a shot that would still take it under, and, with none coming, holds watering and says so (CS-704). A refill runs its fresh water, starts the line and the pump half-way once the level has risen (else CS-702), doses as soon as the fresh water stops and recirculates `mix_s` (10 s) more. It learns what 1% holds from each refill and refuses a fill by hand that would not fit. A level sensor reading nothing for 5 minutes is said (CS-705); watering carries on. The batch record keeps `litres_per_pct`; an older one loads without it, and one saved `settling` is still switched off at the next start. **The dashboard the app serves** shows the level and the new steps.
- **Tests.** A new press of a zone's Test Shot button (the dashboard's Settings → Rooms & hardware → Tests) waters that zone for 10 s at the next pass, through every check a shot passes but a held grow plan's: its water counts toward the day's (`daily_vol`), but not as one of the day's `shots`, and Auto setpoints learns nothing from it; the zone's status reads `Test shot`. The state the button has when the app starts is not a press, nor is one more than 10 minutes old. A Mix a Batch Now press just after the feed plan says `mix_force_until` (a test refill run anyway) is not refused for a fill that might not fit; one whose level reads nothing still is. No new options; no change to the state file. **The dashboard the app serves** has the Tests section.

# 2.30.1

Pair with integration 2.30.1.

- **Auto setpoints leaves P0 its morning dryback.** From its planned stop, through the night and P0, the maintenance trigger sits 2 points under where the dryback target ends (it was 2 points under where its plan expected the night to end: when that was shallower than the target, a night held at the target read under the trigger at lights-on, and P0 was skipped). It publishes the stop time as `p2_stop` on the zone's auto setpoints sensor. **The dashboard the app serves** labels the trigger after it "Maintenance stopped". No change to options or the state file.
- **The dashboard the app serves:** Today's grow day projects the day from P0 for a zone still in last night's P3 after lights-on. No change to the controller.

# 2.30.0

Pair with integration 2.30.0.

- **P3 holds the overnight dryback at its target.** The engine fires a `p3_hold` shot, the rescue shot's size, each time a P3 zone reads below the day's peak less its dryback target, no sooner than the time between P2 shots after the last shot; the daily water limit stops it, and so does a plan that holds steering, while the rescue level stays the floor beneath it. The log names it (`P3 dryback hold shot …`), a zone firing one is labelled `Holding dryback`, and its next line gives the level and the dryback. **The dashboard the app serves** shows the same. No new options; no change to the state file.
- **The dashboard the app serves:** Today's grow day draws P0's line at P0's own additional dryback, not the overnight dryback target. No change to the controller.

# 2.29.2

Pair with integration 2.29.2.

- **The dashboard the app serves:** opens its demo workspace only with `?demo`, no longer by itself on a `github.io` address (the online demo is gone). No change to the controller.

# 2.29.1

Pair with integration 2.29.1.

- **The dashboard the app serves:** Today's events say who changed a setting and what it was, under the zone's own name. No change to the controller.
- **A readable log.** Each line starts with the local date and time (no `[controller]` tag) and names the room and zone as the operator named them. Every minute a zone that does not fire logs its readings, water today, what holds it and what it waits for (`next_text`); a phase change logs why, a shot what kind it is, its seconds, about its litres and why, in `log_words.py`'s words for decide()'s texts. A setting read with a new value is logged with who changed it, from Home Assistant's logbook (`/api/logbook`), a person by name, an automation or script by name; Auto setpoints' own writes as "Auto setpoints lowered …". No change to what is decided, published or saved.

# 2.29.0

Pair with integration 2.29.0.

- **Requires Home Assistant 2026.5.0 or newer**, as the integration now does: `homeassistant: "2026.5.0"` in `config.yaml`. The Supervisor checks it on install and on every update, so on an older Home Assistant it offers no controller update, instead of moving the controller ahead of an integration HACS no longer offers there. No change to the controller or the state file.
- **Its own name in what it says.** The blocked reason for a room switched off is `room off (kill switch)` (was `f2-control disabled (kill switch off)`), in the CS-207 notification and the zone status; the `engine` attribute on the sensors it publishes is `crop-steering-controller` (was `f2-control`); log lines start `[controller]`, and the first one is `Crop Steering Controller X.Y.Z starting`. Entity ids, notification ids, the slug and the state file are unchanged.
- **The EC PID option is removed.** EC Stacking always takes its 1-point step; `input_boolean.crop_steering_ec_pid_enabled` and its gain helpers, which nothing here created, are no longer read. A zone's `ec_integral` and `ec_prev_err` are no longer kept: an old state file still loads, without them. The dashboard the app serves no longer mentions the option.
- **The dashboard the app serves:** a zone added in Rooms & hardware starts at a 3.2 L pot with one 4 L/hr dripper per plant. No change to the controller.
- **Links go to Chill-Division/HA-Irrigation-Strategy**: the app's `url` and its Documentation tab. **The dashboard the app serves:** What's new's release notes link. No change to the controller.
- **The dashboard the app serves:** only `dashboard.html` and the `index.html` its sidebar entry opens. The 13 pages that redirected the original author's old bookmarks (`f2.html`, `office.html`, …) are gone, and so are the old `?room=` and `?view=` names. No change to the controller.
- **Pump prime and main-line lead from the room's settings.** The pump runs `number.crop_steering_<prefix>pump_prime_time` (was a fixed 2 s) before the main line opens, and the main line `..._main_line_lead_time` (was 1 s) before the zone valve. Both are read before anything opens and capped at 20 s and 10 s; under an integration without them, 2 s and 1 s as before. The dashboard the app serves shows them under Pump and valves. No change to the state file.
- **The per-plant daily minimum is removed.** `input_number.crop_steering_<prefix>zone_N_min_daily_ml_per_plant` and `number.crop_steering_<prefix>[zone_N_]min_floor_drown_ceiling`, which nothing here created, are no longer read, and `decide()` has no `min_daily` rule. No change to the state file.
- **Notifications name the dashboard's new pages:** fix a mapping in "Settings → Rooms & hardware" (was Rooms & setup), switch watering back on in "Crop Steering → Overview" (was Settings → Watering, CS-208), and every alert ends "Crop Steering → Help → Error codes" (was Help & tools). Only the words change: ids, the state file and what the controller does are unchanged.
- **The dashboard the app serves:** a menu of six entries with the pages as tabs, the room and watering switches on the Overview, and a grow-day chart twice as tall. No change to the controller.

# 2.28.0

Pair with integration 2.28.0.

- **Moisture levels used as set.** The engine takes a peak VWC target up to 100 (was 85), a P2 trigger up to 100 (was 70), field capacity up to 100 (was 90) and a rescue level up to 65 (was 60): the ranges their settings accept, so it no longer clips them and raises CS-401. Its lower limits are unchanged, and Auto Setpoints' bounds match. No change to the state file.
- **The dashboard the app serves:** overnight, a zone's grow-day line shows how far it has dried from today's peak against the P3 dryback target, not the morning's P0 figure. No change to the controller.
- **The dashboard the app serves:** the Irrigation plan points out a zone's moisture levels that work against each other. No change to the controller.
- **P0 ends on the additional dryback.** `ZoneParams.additional_dryback`, from `number.crop_steering_<prefix>[zone_N_]p0_dryback_drop_percent` (optional; 3 when missing): P0 ends once VWC is that far below its lights-on reading, instead of the P3 dryback target. The dashboard the app serves shows the setting in P0. No change to the state file.

# 2.27.2

Pair with integration 2.27.2.

- **Auto setpoints keeps the afternoon's maintenance shots.** Its day plan (`curve_tracker.plan_day`) stops P2 for the dryback no earlier than 3 hours before lights-off on a Vegetative zone, or the middle of the day on a Generative one (the zone's `select.crop_steering_<prefix>zone_N_steering_mode`), instead of as soon as P1 ends. A dryback it cannot reach is capped, and `sensor.crop_steering_<prefix>zone_N_auto_setpoints` publishes `dryback_note`, which the dashboard the app serves shows. No change to the state file.

# 2.27.1

Pair with integration 2.27.1.

- **Maintenance shots are spaced.** A P2 top-up waits the zone's `number.crop_steering_<prefix>[zone_N_]p2_time_between_shots` (5 minutes unless set; 0 = off) after the last shot. It is read as optional: under an older integration, 5 applies without holding the room. `waiting_for`'s `p2_topup` carries `in_min`, and the vitals' Next line says when the next maintenance shot may fire. No change to the state file.
- **The dashboard the app serves:** readings show to at most three decimals where a raw entity state was shown. No change to the controller.

# 2.27.0

Pair with integration 2.27.0.

- **The dashboard the app serves:** a change Home Assistant refuses says why, instead of "Response error: 500". No change to the controller.
- **The dashboard the app serves:** the substrate preset in Rooms & setup reads Custom unless a preset was just picked there, so a 3.2 L pot is no longer named a Rockwool Hugo block. No change to the controller.

# 2.26.3

Pair with integration 2.26.3.

- **The dashboard the app serves:** a zone's sheet chooses how its probes become its moisture and its EC reading. No change to the controller, which steers on the chosen reading.

# 2.26.2

Pair with integration 2.26.2.

- **Vitals: no clock, no LIVE, and what comes next.** The notification has no `HH:MM` line and no `LIVE`/`HELD`; a room's name heads its lines only when several rooms report, and watering switched off is said. Under each zone, while the room's `switch.crop_steering_<prefix>notify_predictions` is on (or cannot be read), a "Next:" line words the engine's `waiting_for` conditions as the dashboard does (`next_text`). The dashboard the app serves has the switch in Settings.

# 2.26.1

Pair with integration 2.26.1.

- **The dashboard the app serves:** Stock tanks can put each tank on the Reservoir doser it feeds. No change to the controller.
- **The dashboard the app serves:** a dryback target reads "% below peak". No change to the controller.

# 2.26.0

Pair with integration 2.26.0.

Two options are removed, `feed_ec_sensor` and `feed_ph_sensor`: Supervisor drops them from an old configuration. No change to the state file.

- **Waits for its settings.** A setting `_zone_num` has to fill in with a built-in value holds the room's shots (`_blocked`: "waiting for its settings to load") until it has been missing for `SETTINGS_WAIT_PASSES` (3) passes, when CS-402 is raised and the built-in value is used, as before. While Home Assistant starts or the integration reloads, the numbers are missing for a moment.
- **Says when it stops.** On SIGTERM (an update, a restart or a stop), after closing a shot in flight and saving state, each room's heartbeat is set to `stopped` with `stopped_at`, without `strategy_snapshot_version`. The dashboard the app serves shows it.
- **No source-water gate.** The controller no longer reads a feed EC or pH probe or holds watering on one. A setup fingerprint saved with the feed sensors is compared without them, so an adopted room resumes. The dashboard the app serves has no tank EC or pH.
- **Mixes nutrient batches.** For a room whose setup maps a reservoir (`reservoir_distance_sensor`, `fresh_water_switch`, `recirc_switch`, `doser_N_switch`), `_batch_tick` runs a batch from the integration's `sensor.crop_steering_<prefix>feed_plan`: the fresh water for `fill_s`, the recirculation then the pump, `settle_s`, each dose's doser for its seconds in the room's order (`pause_s` between), `mix_s`, then the pump off before the recirculation. It starts on a Mix a Batch Now press (ignored when seen more than 30 minutes late; refused unless the reservoir reads almost empty when it has a level sensor and a mark) or, with `switch.crop_steering_<prefix>auto_batches` on, after three almost-empty readings, once until the level reads fuller. Refusals raise CS-703, a reservoir that did not fill CS-702 (nothing dosed), a stop part-way CS-701; a switch that will not read off latches CS-301. A batch holds its room's shots, and every room's while it fills or doses; while it fills or doses the loop checks it every 5 s between passes, so switching the room's watering off stops it within seconds. One new key in a room's block of the state file, `_batch`, which an old state file does not have and does not need; a batch in progress when the app died is switched off at the next start. Publishes `sensor.crop_steering_<prefix>batch_status`. A room without a reservoir keeps its setup fingerprint.
- **Starts with the host.** `boot: auto`: Start on boot is on by default. Supervisor keeps an owner's own setting where one was ever saved, so only an app nobody switched changes.

# 2.25.0

Pair with integration 2.25.0.

Three options are removed, `cf_account_id`, `cf_api_token` and `cf_gateway_id`: Supervisor drops them from an old configuration. The state file keeps what each zone learned and drops the Cloudflare judge's keys (`peak_adj`, `jev`, `veto`) on load.

- **Retired switches.** `_carry_retired_switches` switches the room's engine switch off while System Enabled or Auto Irrigation Enabled reads off (CS-208), and `_blocked` no longer gates on them; a missing or unreadable one changes nothing.
- **A zone switched off stops its running shot.** `_wait_shot` reads the zone's `switch.crop_steering_<prefix>zone_N_enabled` every round with the engine switch, Room Active and manual override; CS-305 names the switch that stopped the shot.
- **Publishes what each zone waits for.** `sensor.crop_steering_<prefix>zone_N_waiting_for_app` every pass, from the engine's `waiting_for`: for the phase the zone is in after this pass, and an empty list for a zone with no usable probe or a room that is off.
- **The vitals follow the room.** A room with no feed EC probe leaves feed EC out of its line, and one whose probe reads nothing usable says "unreadable". When the room's `select.crop_steering_<prefix>water_today_view` says `PER_PLANT`, each zone's water today is divided by its plant count: "344 mL/plant day".
- **No Cloudflare judge.** Auto Setpoints is arithmetic only: `jev_policy.py` is gone, the working peak is the learned peak, and the P2 shot size is no longer managed or written. The `auto_setpoints` sensor no longer publishes `jev`, `jev_last`, `jev_changed_today` or `working_peak_adjust`.
- **The dashboard the app serves** is this release's build: each zone's "Next:", the switch over every zone, Water today per plant and What's new, and no judge in the Auto status.

# 2.24.0

Pair with integration 2.24.0. **C3.** Owner-approved rehearsal release without a staging soak (26 Sep 2026); not run on hardware before release. No change to add-on options. One new key in the state file, `_room_off_since` in a room's block, which an old state file does not have and does not need.

- **No shot while a switch is offline.** `_blocked` returns `<switches> offline (reads neither on nor off)` when the zone's pump, main line or valve reads anything but `on`/`off`, checked last so every other reason keeps priority. Nothing is opened and no hardware hold latches; the zone waters once the switch reads again. A switch that goes offline during a shot still latches CS-301.
- **A dead probe waits 15 minutes.** `BLIND_GRACE_MIN` = 15: a zone whose probe has been unreadable for less than that in this run gets no timer shot, sibling copy or CS-102 alert (`blind_wait`); the time rules still apply.
- **A room switched back on within a day carries on.** The switch-off time is saved as `_room_off_since`; switched on less than `ROOM_RESUME_H` = 24 h later, the room keeps its phases, today's counters and learned state. Longer, or unknown, starts the fresh run as before.
- **A zone can be moved to a phase by hand** with the integration's new `select.crop_steering_zone_N_set_phase`. `_apply_phase_request` resets the select to Keep and only then moves the zone, once; it actuates nothing and does not need the kill switch.
- **Keeps reporting during a shot.** `_wait_shot` repeats the room's heartbeat and zone labels once they are a minute old (at most two short writes per round, so the kill switch is still read about every 2 s), and a room is reported before its first shot after a restart or a switch-on.
- **The dashboard the app serves** is the 2.24.0 build: the setting names and explainers, the Watering switch in the status line and Settings, and the zone's Phase section.
# 2.23.0

Pair with integration 2.23.0. **C1** for the controller app: no behaviour change; its code changes in comments only (the syntax tree is unchanged). Owner-approved rehearsal release without a staging soak (25 Sep 2026). No change to add-on options, the state file or irrigation.

- **The dashboard the app serves** is the 2.23.0 build: each zone's lane on the Overview's grow-day chart shows its target, yesterday and the projected rest of the day.
- **Configuration tab:** `instance_name`, `hold_entities` and `rediscover_seconds` now have a name and a description, and the `notify_service` example is neutral.

# 2.22.0

Pair with integration 2.22.0. **C1** for the controller app: no controller code change. Owner-approved rehearsal release without a staging soak (25 Sep 2026). No change to add-on options, the state file or irrigation.

- **The dashboard the app serves** (`www/public/dashboard.html`) is the 2.22.0 build: the Stock tanks page, mini visuals on every page, water use per zone, typing the balance into the whole-grow table, the tank's EC and pH history, and "Watering" instead of "Controller not running" while a shot holds the controller.

# 2.21.0

Pair with integration 2.21.0, one number for both halves from this release on. **C3.** Owner-approved rehearsal release without a staging soak (25 Sep 2026); not run on hardware before release. No change to add-on options or the state file.

- **C3. A shot interrupted by a Home Assistant restart is closed, not left running.** After a restart (or a switch reconnecting) Home Assistant reports every switch as changed at that moment, so `_inflight_plan` took the interrupted shot's own open valve for a person's and left it on without an alert. When `last_changed` falls outside `INFLIGHT_OPEN_WINDOW_S`, the new `ha_history()` + `_on_since_shot()` read the recorder: ON since the shot opened it, with only `unavailable`/`unknown` between, is the shot's and is closed; an OFF since, or ON before the shot, is a person's; no history is `unsure` (CS-309, retried every loop). Not run on hardware. No change to options or the state file.
- **C1, dashboard only.** The dashboard the app serves (`www/public/dashboard.html`) is rebuilt with the Overview's grow-day timeline and the dashboard changes in the integration's changelog (the Overview's layout and a calmer look on every page). No change to options, the state file or irrigation.
- **C3. A shot that something else cuts short ends there, and only its water is counted.** 23 Sep, 11:25: the batch tank ran empty 4 s into a 170 s shot, the dosing hold came on and a guard closed the feed path, and the controller waited out and counted all 170 s. `_wait_shot` now also ends a shot when a `hold_entities` entity reads ON or the shot's own valve reads OFF after being seen ON, with the same bounded reads and ≤2 s cadence; the kill switch, room switch and override are read first and still win. `_close_cut_short` switches off the shot's valve and main line unless they read OFF, and its pump unless it reads OFF or a hold is ON. It reads back only what it switched off, clears `shot_inflight` as a normal close does, and never latches a hardware hold for a feed path somebody else closed. Counted time: the valve's `last_changed` when it falls inside the shot, else when the interruption was seen; the shot counts as a kill-switch abort does. One debounced alert names the entity and the seconds delivered against planned. Not run on hardware. No change to options or the state file.

# 0.16.5

Pair with integration 2.19.5. **C3.** Owner-approved rehearsal release without a staging soak (23 Sep 2026); not run on hardware before release. No change to add-on options or the state file.

- **A held grow plan never stops an emergency, watchdog or minimum-daily shot.** Each zone the plan holds is decided with the engine's new `ZoneSnapshot.steering_held`, so `decide()` returns the rescue behind a routine shot; `_blocked` and the shot preflight let `PLAN_HOLD_EXEMPT` kinds (`p3_emergency`, `watchdog`, `min_daily`, and for a blind zone `blind_fallback` and `blind_copy_rescue`) through the plan hold, and every other gate still applies. A held zone that is not firing shows the hold as its block. No change to options or the state file. Pairs with the integration's plan fixes in the same release (a plan no longer holds a room all day over a missed lights-on).
- **Zone status has one writer.** The controller publishes each zone's label, with its reason, on `sensor.crop_steering_<prefix>zone_N_status_app` (`Room off` included) and no longer writes `zone_N_status`, which the integration now mirrors from it. With an older integration, `zone_N_status` shows that integration's fixed-threshold label until it is updated. No change to options, the state file or irrigation.

# 0.16.4

Pair with integration 2.19.4. **C1.** No controller code change: the dashboard served by the app is the 2.19.4 build (controller-health status line, live updates instead of polling). No change to options, the state file or irrigation.

# 0.16.3

Pair with integration 2.19.3. **C3.** Owner-approved rehearsal release without a staging soak (23 Sep 2026); not run on hardware before release. No change to add-on options.

- **A room deleted and set up again is adopted afresh** (#50): the descriptor's `entry_id` changing re-opens adoption through the usual gate (kill switch and hardware OFF); first sight changes nothing, so a running room resumes without a disarm cycle.
- Installed only from `JakeTheRabbit/HA-Irrigation-Strategy`; the `f2-control` mirror is retired. `url` in `config.yaml` now points here. No change to options, the state file or irrigation.

- **The daily limit is a budget with typed exemptions.** The watchdog, P3 emergency and high-EC flushes (anti-lockout, P2 rescue) pass it, and so does the P1 ramp, which always runs in full. Top-ups, P1/P2/P0 EC-correction shots and the min-daily floor stop at it. A shot that would cross it is cut to what is left (under 5 s: held, `BLOCK daily-cap (x L left)`). The "flush" in a reason's text no longer makes a shot exempt.
- **A zone over budget and starving gets the watchdog shot** instead of nothing (22 Sep: Z1 dry 14:06-22:00). No watchdog in P0: the night no longer counts as "no water" at lights-on.
- **P1 at its ceiling, held open only by pore EC, completes once the budget is spent.**
- **Pore EC is settled EC.** Every EC rule uses the last reading taken 45 minutes after a shot, held in between; EC corrections wait for the next settled reading. Only settled readings feed the EC offset step / PID. Published as `ec_settled` on each zone's safety status.
- **A new grow-day resets a zone found in P1/P2** (the controller was not running across lights-off), and yesterday's EC offset is cleared before the first tick of the day.
- **Interrupted shots.** Each shot writes down what it will open before opening it; the next loop closes exactly that, only while the room's kill switch is ON and only switches ON continuously since the shot opened them. Anything a person has switched since (hand-watering, tank circulation), everything upstream of it, the main line and pump while another valve on the line is open, and the pump while a hold is on, are left alone. Nothing is switched off on a timer.
- **Stopping the app closes only what is in flight.** SIGTERM (stop, update, restart) used to switch off every mapped pump and valve; it now closes only the shot running, by the same rules, and counts its water. With no shot running it switches nothing off, so tank circulation and hand-watering carry on through an update. The error-cleanup read-back is as patient as the normal one (no false hold from a late Zigbee OFF report); alerts are only silenced once Home Assistant has them, and a hardware hold latched while it was unreachable is announced once it is back.
- State file: additive `_shot_inflight` (room block), `ec_settled` / `ec_settled_at` (zone). An old file loads; the 0.16.2 controller loads the new one.

# 0.16.2

Pair with integration 2.19.2. **C3.** Found on the first real install (a one-zone tent); the fixes themselves were not run on hardware before release.

- **Zones are never invented.** Started before the integration was set up, the controller fell back to the shipped `num_zones: 3` and reported zones 2 and 3 of a one-zone tent as "no hardware mapped". It now has no zones until a room exists, checks every loop, and picks the room up by itself: no restart needed. The log says so: *"the Crop Steering integration has not published a room yet..."*. `num_zones` is still the fallback when Home Assistant cannot be reached at start, and a hand-mapped `hardware` option still keeps its zone count. A state file that already holds the phantom zones loads as before.
- **Switch-on is no longer an irrigation event.** New switch-on timestamps are explicitly marked by `last_shot_is_anchor` and published as `unknown` until an irrigation is recorded, also for a room that is off. An old file without the flag keeps its timestamp: zero daily counters or missing history cannot establish whether an old timestamp was switch-on or irrigation. Electrical operation alone does not prove water delivery.
- Final review fixes keep the descriptor's complete zone list when HA sensors appear gradually, preserve old irrigation timestamps after daily rollover, and keep legacy numeric-string/malformed excluded-volume state loadable. Regression tests cover each case.
- The dashboard served by the app is the 2.19.2 build (the side menu scrolls on small screens).
- No change to add-on options. No change to what a working install waters, or when.

# 0.16.1

Pair with integration 2.19.1. Not run on hardware before release.

- The controller reports its own version: `controller_version` in every room's `ai_heartbeat`, and in the first log line (`f2-control 0.16.x starting | rooms ...`). The dashboard's sidebar shows it next to the integration's. It is read from the `config.yaml` the image was built from (copied in as `/app/addon.yaml`), so there is no second number to keep in step.
- No change to irrigation behaviour, options or the state file.

# 0.16.0

Pair with integration 2.19.0. **C3.** Released without a staging soak by decision of its two operators; not run on hardware before release.

- A room can DECLARE its plumbing (`plumbing` in the engine descriptor, set in the integration's setup). Declared: the mapped pump and main-line have to match it, or the room is held with a reason, nothing opens and nothing is counted. This closes the 2.18.0 case where a pumped room with no pump mapped was watered with the valve open and no pump, and the shot counted as delivered.
- **Never declared (every existing install): no change**, and no disarm cycle after the update. The layout joins the saved setup fingerprint only when it is present, so the fingerprint 0.15.x saved still matches.
- A layout this controller does not know (a newer integration) is held, not guessed.
- No change to add-on options or to the state file.

# 0.15.2

Pair with integration 2.18.1. No change to irrigation behaviour, options or saved state.

- Test seam: the state file location can be overridden with the `F2_STATE_PATH` environment variable. **Unset, as on every install, it is `/data/state.json` exactly as before.** The constructor reads that file, and on adopting a setup writes it, before a test can redirect it; GitHub runners have no `/data`, so CI never noticed, but on any machine where `/data` exists and is writable (a devcontainer, this add-on's own container) the test suite wrote a real file there and leaked it into the next test.
- Bundles nothing new; the dashboard is the 2.18.0 build.

# 0.15.1

- A room switched off stays off while Home Assistant restarts. The room's on/off switch reads unavailable for a moment during a core restart, and unavailable used to mean on: an empty room began a fresh run and raised its probe alerts again. The controller now keeps the last value it read (also across its own restart) and only treats a switch it has never seen as on, which is what keeps integrations older than the switch watering.

# 0.15.0

Pair with integration 2.18.0. Existing options, engine flags, room IDs, counters and learned state are kept.
Updating from 0.14.0 resumes by itself; no kill-switch cycle is needed.

- A zone needs only its valve. Pump and main-line valve are optional, so a room with one smart plug or solenoid per zone irrigates. Lead times are skipped with the hardware they belong to; the close read-back and the hardware-fault latch cover whatever the room has. Three-switch rooms run exactly as before.
- The source-water EC probe may report µS/cm; it is converted to mS/cm before the sanity range and the gate. Previously such a probe read as out of range and the gate blocked every shot without saying why.
- The Cloudflare judge manages P2. With Auto Setpoints on and `cf_account_id` + `cf_api_token` set, `typesafe/jev` is asked once per clock hour during P2 (lights on, no dated plan). It may move the zone's `p2_shot_size` within 1-4 % and hold the working peak within 2 points of the learned one: one bounded step per lever per grow-day. A tripped guard, a low-confidence answer, or no answer in 5 s changes nothing; irrigation never waits on it. Status attributes `jev_last`, `jev_changed_today`, `working_peak_adjust`.
- Bundles the 2.18.0 dashboard (setup helpers in Rooms & setup).

# 0.14.0

Pair with integration 2.17.0. Existing options, engine flags, room IDs, counters and learned state are kept.
**After this update, turn the engine kill switch off and on once**: the previous build saved no record of the
setup it had accepted, so this first start has nothing to resume from. Later restarts and reboots carry on by themselves.

- Room on/off: `switch.crop_steering_<prefix>room_active` off means no irrigation of any kind and no alerts for that room.
- P1 no longer ends on a clock. It runs until the target is recovered after `p1_minimum_shots`, or `p1_maximum_shots` is reached.
- Auto Setpoints (off by default): learns each zone's ceiling, gain and dry-down; on a P1 plateau hands over to P2 and carries the achieved peak forward. Optional Cloudflare `typesafe/jev` check via the new `cf_*` options.
- The accepted setup revision is saved with a fingerprint, so an unchanged setup resumes after a restart with the kill switch left on (hardware must read off). A pending setup raises a notification naming what must read off.
- Switch read-back after a shot re-reads for up to 6 s instead of once at 1 s: a late Zigbee report no longer latches a false hardware hold.
- Bundles the 2.17.0 dashboard (recorded sensor data and the projected P0-P3 day on the Today graph).

# 0.13.3

- Combine daily targets and dated plans under Irrigation plan, with Today and Schedule views.
- Join schematic VWC and EC references through the night and into the next day.
- Show effective scheduled targets instead of disabled manual fallback fields when a schedule owns the room.
- Dashboard-only correction; controller decisions and stored settings are unchanged.

# 0.13.2

- Bundle graphical tank/pump telemetry and current zone state with last irrigation timestamps.
- Publish irrigation event timestamps with an explicit timezone offset.
- Include synthetic demo recipes/runs and the Home Assistant sidebar recovery button.

# Changelog — Crop Steering add-on

The full project changelog (integration + add-on) lives at
<https://github.com/JakeTheRabbit/HA-Irrigation-Strategy/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md>.

## 0.13.1

- Read the same-room legacy maximum-shot-duration entity when the canonical entity is absent, matching the dashboard calculator and reviewed edits. Reject an invalid existing duration cap before actuation.
- Bundle the user-authored recipe library and pair with integration 2.15.0. Existing room identities, options and persistent controller data remain compatible.

## 0.13.0

- Pair with integration 2.14.0 for reactive manual setpoint previews, run comparisons and clear zone/per-plant water calculations.
- Calculate new delivery counters from configured zone flow and elapsed valve runtime, including capped/truncated/minimum shots and partial aborts. Snapshot sizing before each shot so a mid-shot configuration edit cannot rewrite its volume.
- Keep existing options, engine flags, room IDs, learned state and old daily/weekly totals. Delivery remains a flow-based estimate, not a meter reading.

## 0.12.1

- Correct room names in the bundled workspace when HA descriptor sensors share a generic friendly name.
- Pair with integration 2.13.2. Irrigation decisions, options and persistent state format are unchanged from 0.12.0.

## 0.12.0

Update the Crop Steering integration to 2.13.0 before updating this controller. Existing options, enable flags, room IDs and persistent runtime data are retained.

- Serve the native dashboard with per-zone day/week grow plans and a combined VWC/EC planning graph.
- Read versioned setup and strategy snapshots, with explicit configuration acknowledgement and safe holds for invalid required plans.
- Correct low-flow sizing, elapsed duration accounting, volume caps, stale sequential decisions and shared-hardware recovery.
- Remove historical package examples from the installation bundle; sensor and equipment mapping belongs to the integration.

- Missing pore EC keeps base VWC shot sizing and pauses EC offset/PID adaptation, with a visible degraded status.
- Feed EC/pH and pore readings require finite values and valid, fresh, timezone-aware timestamps (60 seconds future-skew tolerance).
- Weekly delivery estimates persist seven grow-day buckets, include interrupted delivery and expose incomplete legacy history.

## 0.11.0

> **⚠️ Update the Crop Steering integration BEFORE rebuilding this add-on.** The engine now reads
> the default room's pump/mainline/valves from the integration's `sensor.crop_steering_engine_config`.
> On an old integration that doesn't publish it, the default room **holds safe (no watering)** until
> the integration is updated (the engine re-checks every 5 minutes and resumes on its own).

- **Portability:** default-room hardware comes from the integration's engine_config descriptor —
  the hardcoded F2 pump/valve fallback is gone. An unmapped room holds safe with a clear
  "no hardware mapped" reason instead of actuating another install's entities.
- **Kill switch works mid-shot:** shots are delivered in ≤2 s slices that re-check the kill switch
  and the zone's manual override; an abort closes the valve immediately and counts only the water
  actually delivered.
- **`notify_service` default is now empty** — unset means persistent notifications only (no more
  default pointing at the developer's phone). If you had it set explicitly, nothing changes.
- **Dosing/fill/flush holds are now the `hold_entities` option (empty default).** The previously
  hardcoded F2 hold entities (`input_boolean.nutrient_dosing_active`, `input_boolean.f2_fill_mode`,
  `input_boolean.f2_flush_mode`, `switch.tank_filling`) are no longer checked automatically —
  add yours to `hold_entities` in the Configuration tab or that gate stays off.
- **Live room discovery:** rooms added in the integration UI join within `rediscover_seconds`
  (default 300 s) without an add-on restart, fail-safe OFF.
- **Missing-setpoint alerts:** if a `number.crop_steering_*` setpoint entity disappears (per-zone
  AND global) for 3+ loops, you get one rate-limited alert + a vitals line instead of the engine
  silently running built-in defaults.
- **Timezone hardening:** tzdata baked into the image; startup logs the effective local time and
  alerts if the container clock disagrees with Home Assistant's configured zone.
- Heartbeat sensors publish the room's `enable_flag` (used by the integration's Repairs health
  checks); vitals title uses the new `instance_name` option.

## 0.10.5
- **Fix: zones could freeze in P2 if the fused-sensor entity_id didn't match.** The engine read
  each zone's probe at `sensor.crop_steering_<room>vwc_zone_N` / `ec_zone_N`, but on a box first set
  up under an older integration the HA registry keeps the legacy id `..._zone_N_vwc` / `_zone_N_ec`
  forever. The mismatch made every zone read as "blind" → `decide()` was skipped → the P0-P3 phase
  machine stopped (it never even forced P3 at lights-off), and the zones sat on a blind timer. The
  engine now resolves each fused sensor under **both** naming conventions (and `_detect_zones` counts
  either), so it finds the probe regardless of which id the registry assigned.
- **Hardening — a dead probe can no longer strand the daily cycle.** A blind zone still honours the
  time-based phase forces (lights-off → P3, P3 → P0 at the new photoperiod) even while VWC-driven
  steering is paused, so it can't freeze overnight. The "probe dead" alert now **repeats** (every
  ~30 min while blind) with the exact entity_id the engine is looking for, instead of firing once and
  going silent.

## 0.10.4
- **Engine Log panel now works.** It used to tail `/local/f2_engine.log`, which the add-on can't write
  (no `/config` map) — so it was always empty. It now reads the engine's published decision feed
  (`sensor.crop_steering_activity_log`), room-scoped, and only re-renders when the feed changes (also
  removes the 4s render churn).
- **"Next" on the irrigation-frequency card.** The engine now publishes a per-zone next-shot estimate
  `sensor.crop_steering_<room>_prediction_zone_N_next_irrigation_hours` (P2: time for VWC to dry to the
  re-water threshold at the current dryback rate; "—" when not computable).
- **Safety (HA-down observability):** the shot CLOSE sequence now checks every `turn_off` and reads the
  valve back HA-aware — a failed/unconfirmed close (e.g. HA unreachable mid-shot) raises a CRITICAL
  alert instead of silently reading as "closed". The shot is still counted (water was delivered) so the
  daily cap stays honest. NOTE: software cannot close a valve when HA is down — the hardware fail-safe
  (NC valves, pump-relay default-off, an independent watchdog) is the real guarantee.

## 0.10.3
- **Diagnostic:** f2.html logs one `[f2-perf]` console line per 30s tick (JS heap, DOM-node count +
  delta, Chart-instance count) to pinpoint the dashboard lag. Open the console, filter `[f2-perf]`,
  leave it until it lags, and watch which number climbs. Harmless; removed once the leak is found.

## 0.10.2
- **Fix: per-zone "Volume fed vs daily cap" + "Irrigation frequency" tiles were blank (—).** The engine
  now publishes `sensor.crop_steering_<room>_zone_N_daily_water_app` (litres fed today) and
  `..._irrigation_count_app` (shots today) — the data was already tracked in zone state, just not
  republished. Resets at the lights-on (P3→P0) rollover like the other daily counters. (Per room.)

## 0.10.1
- **Per-room dashboards (`?room=<slug>`).** The operator console (`f2.html`) and the mobile one-pager
  (`overview.html`) now scope to an additional room with `?room=f1` etc. — every `crop_steering_*`
  read/write is routed to that room's entities (two chokepoints, no per-id edits), the kill-switch
  button controls the **room's** kill switch, and a badge shows which room you're viewing. No `?room=`
  (default room) is unchanged.

## 0.10.0
- **Multi-room engine.** One add-on now drives **every** configured room, not just the first.
  Refactored around a `Room` abstraction; each room is a fully self-contained control loop with its
  own pump/mainline/valves, reservoir pH/EC feed gate, photoperiod, kill switch and durable state,
  namespaced `crop_steering_<slug>_*`. Additional rooms are discovered from the integration's published
  `sensor.crop_steering_<prefix>engine_config` descriptors and come up **fail-safe OFF**
  (`switch.crop_steering_<slug>_engine_enabled`, default off). The default room is byte-identical to
  before. `/data/state.json` is nested by room; an old flat single-room file still loads transparently.

## 0.9.1
- New logo (cannabis leaf + green growth chart + rising arrow, with the Home Assistant and Python
  marks). Updated the add-on icon and logo.

## 0.9.0
- **Vmax advisory.** The engine now watches each zone's morning P1 wet-up and publishes the detected
  field-capacity ceiling as `sensor.crop_steering_zone_N_vmax_detected` (with a confidence attribute).
  Advisory only — it does **not** change any irrigation decision. Pairs with the integration's
  named-stage recipes (2.10.0).
- Re-synced the vendored `crop_steering_engine` with the canonical source.

## 0.8.3
- Use the original Open Crop Steering logo artwork (leaf + water-drop in a green ring) for the
  add-on icon and logo, instead of the redrawn version.

## 0.8.2
- New logo (cannabis leaf + growth chart), matching the project mark.

## 0.8.1
- Fix: the dripper flow rate + drippers/plant now drive shot length even if a per-zone plant
  count is unset (it used to fall back to a generic flow value). Plant count cancels out of the
  duration maths, so it no longer gates the dripper settings.

## 0.8.0
- Generic out of the box: the source-water pH/EC feed gate is now **optional**. Set
  `feed_ec_sensor` / `feed_ph_sensor` to your reservoir probes to enable it; leave them blank to
  disable it (dosing / tank-fill holds still apply). Removed the hardcoded F2 probe defaults; the
  substrate/flow fallbacks are neutral placeholders.

## 0.7.0
- Renamed **F2 Control → Crop Steering** with a new logo. Proper description + feature list
  (Documentation tab) and this changelog. The dashboards are served as a sidebar panel
  (toggle **Show in sidebar** on the Info tab).

## 0.6.0
- **Configure once**: lights hours and zone count are now read from the integration, so the
  add-on options for them are just fallbacks. Ends the "lights out of sync" class of bug.

## 0.5.0
- The engine reads each zone's **fused** sensor (`sensor.crop_steering_vwc_zone_N` /
  `ec_zone_N`), so you can add **any number of probes per zone** in the integration UI and the
  engine uses all of them (averaged, outliers rejected). Removed the hardcoded zone sensors.

## 0.4.0
- Bundled the operator **dashboards into the add-on**, served over Home Assistant **ingress**
  (sidebar panel) with a Live/Demo chooser — no more copying `f2.html` to `/config/www`.

## 0.3.0
- Friendlier title + **custom icon**; help **tooltips** on every Configuration option.

## 0.2.0
- First standalone add-on release: pure crop-steering engine + REST IO + 30-min vitals,
  gated by the kill switch. Replaces the retired legacy engine.
