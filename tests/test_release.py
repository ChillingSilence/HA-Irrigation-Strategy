"""One command releases the repository (scripts/release.py): it dates the Unreleased notes, sets
every version and checks the result before anything is committed, pushed or published.

Only the pure part is tested here: what the release commit will contain, and when to refuse. The
version files are the repository's own, so a change to their format that the release would miss
fails here first.
