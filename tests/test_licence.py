"""The MIT licence travels with every part a box installs, and the README credits where Crop
Steering began.

HACS installs only custom_components/crop_steering, the app's image is built from addons/f2_control
alone, and the engine is its own package: each carries its own copy of LICENSE, which the licence asks
for in every copy. The dashboard is built from open-source packages whose licences ask the same, so
the build ships THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.txt beside it (frontend/vite.config.ts).
