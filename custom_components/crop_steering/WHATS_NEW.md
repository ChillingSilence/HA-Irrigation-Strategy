# What's new

The dashboard's **What's new** window shows these to the first person who opens the dashboard after
an update: every release since the last one it showed there, newest first, at most five. A new
installation has nothing to catch up on and shows none. **Help → What's new** opens it again at
any time.

A change a grower would notice adds one line under `## Unreleased` at the top, in its own pull
request, and `scripts/release.py` dates them as the release. Write it for growers, not for the
people who build the system:

- **At most five short lines a release**, one for each change a grower would notice: what they can
  now do or see, in plain words, not how it was built.
- **No entity ids, error codes, file names, pull request numbers or code.** The release notes and
  the changelog keep the detail, and the window links to them.
- **Put the small things together** as one last line: `Bug fixes and improvements.` A release with
  nothing a grower would notice has only that line.
- Each line starts with `- `. The release command writes the heading,
  `## <version> - <release date, YYYY-MM-DD>`, and puts the small things last.

`tests/test_whats_new.py` checks the shape and the plain words, and that the newest section is the
version being released.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-10-05

- This is version 1.0, the first release for everyone.
- A new icon, a tank of water with a seedling in front of it: in the menu, in HACS and in Settings → Apps.
- Bug fixes and improvements.
