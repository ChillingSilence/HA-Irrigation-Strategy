# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working in this repository.

## What this is

An autonomous **4-phase crop-steering irrigation** system for Home Assistant. Two
runtime layers plus the React/shadcn operator workspace:

1. **HA integration** (`custom_components/crop_steering/`) — entities, config-flow
   wizard, pure calculations, service events. Never touches hardware.
2. **f2-control add-on** (`addons/f2_control/`) — the live autonomous coordinator.
   A single synchronous Python process that polls HA over REST every 60 s, imports
   the pure `crop-steering-engine` package, runs the per-zone P0→P1→P2→P3 logic,
   and drives the hardware. Gated by kill switch
   `input_boolean.f2_control_enabled` (OFF = safe, no actuation).

The native UI source is frontend/src. Setup and strategy APIs persist revisioned data; active plans override canonical targets atomically at a local lights-on boundary. See docs/REPOSITORY_MAP.md and docs/GROW_PLANS.md.

> Start with `docs/SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md` for the whole-stack mental model, then
> `README.md`. `docs/ENTITIES.md` is the entity reference.

## Dev commands

```bash
# Lint / format / yaml (matches CI; black is scoped — the add-on is
# deployed file-for-file to installs and stays exempt from reformatting)
ruff check . && black --check custom_components/ tests/ && yamllint .

# Tests — integration calculation helpers (lean: hand-written HA stubs, no Home Assistant)
PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1 python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Tests — the integration inside a REAL Home Assistant: fresh install, that install handed to
# the real add-on controller, and in-place upgrades from seeded snapshots of old installs.
# Needs `pip install -r requirements-test-ha.txt` (Python 3.14.2+); see docs/TESTING.md.
python -m pytest tests_ha -q

# Tests — crop-steering-engine package
PYTHONPATH=crop-steering-engine/src python -m pytest crop-steering-engine/tests -q

# f2-control add-on logs (supervised HA)
#   ha addons logs <f2_control_slug>     (or: docker logs addon_<slug> -f)
```

`PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1` dodges a broken hydra/omegaconf plugin in some
local Python installs. CI is unaffected.

## Architecture

### 1. HA integration — `custom_components/crop_steering/`
- About 90 entities for a one-zone room (numbers, switches, selects, sensors) via a config-flow UI; no YAML.
- Services: `set_manual_override`, `apply_recipe`, `save_recipe`, and the `setup_*`, `strategy_*`,
  `runs_*`, `stock_*`, `feed_*` and `whats_new_*` families and `test_shot`, which the dashboard calls.
- Pure, testable helpers in `calculations.py`.

### 2. f2-control add-on — `addons/f2_control/` (live engine)
- Single synchronous Python process; polls HA REST API every 60 s.
- Imports `crop-steering-engine` (pure Python package at `crop-steering-engine/src/`);
  no external runtime dependency.
- Responsibilities: phase transitions, hardware sequencing, dryback detection,
  fail-closed hardware writes (aborts shot on valve/pump fault), P2 EC-correction min-interval (anti-short-cycle),
  daily caps,
  sensor-fusion republish, 30-min operator vitals, and nutrient batches for a room with a
  reservoir mapped (refill with the pump from half-way, dose each doser in order, recirculate:
  `_batch_tick`, from the integration's `sensor.crop_steering_<prefix>feed_plan`), keeping the
  reservoir above its minimum (a refill planned from the next round of shots, or watering held).
- Shot volume is substrate litres per plant x plants x shot fraction. Duration is shot litres divided by total flow L/s (plants x drippers/plant x L/h/dripper / 3600), followed by the explicit safety cap. Validate positive flow without a hidden clamp.
- Add-on config: `addons/f2_control/config.yaml`. Options set via Supervisor UI.

### Critical files
- `custom_components/crop_steering/config_flow.py` — setup wizard.
- `custom_components/crop_steering/{sensor,number,switch,select}.py` — entity platforms.
- `custom_components/crop_steering/calculations.py` — pure helpers (tested).
- `custom_components/crop_steering/const.py` — constants, single source of truth.
- `addons/f2_control/f2_control/controller.py` — live engine IO shell (read → decide → drive).
- `crop-steering-engine/src/crop_steering_engine/core.py` — pure `decide()` core imported by the add-on.

## Phase logic (P0–P3)

```
P0 (Morning dryback): after lights-on, wait for an X% VWC DROP FROM PEAK → P1
P1 (Ramp-up):         progressive shots to the per-zone target → P2
P2 (Maintenance):     top-up when VWC drops below the per-zone threshold → P3
P3 (Pre-lights-off):  dry back to the dryback target and hold it there with rescue-sized shots;
                      the rescue level is the floor beneath → P0 at lights-on
```

- A "grow-day" is one **photoperiod**. The daily water + shot counters reset at the
  **P3→P0 transition (lights-on)**, not at calendar midnight.
- Lights-off forces any P1/P2 zone to P3 (no zone strands mid-cycle overnight).
- **Dryback semantics:** controller dryback_target is a relative percent of detected peak: (peak - VWC) / peak * 100. At 60% peak and 10% target, the reference is 54% VWC. Rate calculations use VWC percentage points/hour; convert units explicitly.

## Hardware control sequence

```
Safety checks → Pump prime (Pump Prime Time, 2 s unless set) → Mainline (Main Line Lead Time, 1 s unless set) → Zone valve → Irrigate → Shutdown (reverse)
```

Valve close is read-back verified; failure triggers an emergency pump stop and aborts
the shot. Lives in the f2-control add-on (`addons/f2_control/`).

## Key entity patterns

- Global: `crop_steering_<param>` (e.g. `number.crop_steering_p2_shot_size`).
- Per-zone: `crop_steering_zone_X_<param>`.
- Sensors: `sensor.crop_steering_<metric>`; services: `crop_steering.<action>`.
- The engine reads switches/numbers by `entity_id` — renaming a friendly-name in HA
  or the dashboard does not affect it.

## Notes

- **Dependencies:** integration = pure HA + voluptuous (no external deps). Engine
  (`crop-steering-engine`) = pure Python, no scipy/numpy; the f2-control add-on image
  installs its one dependency, `requests`, in `addons/f2_control/Dockerfile`.
- **Testing:** see `docs/TESTING.md`; run `bash tests/run_ci.sh` (mirrors CI). Anything that touches the
  config flow, entity ids/platforms or the integration-controller contract must be proven in `tests_ha/`
  (a real Home Assistant), not only against the stubs in `tests/`: the stubs cannot see a schema HA
  rejects, an HA API missing from an older version, or an entity id HA assigns, and all three have
  shipped. In `tests_ha/` stand in only for what a test genuinely cannot have (the web server), never
  for the code under test. An in-place-upgrade claim needs a seeded snapshot in `tests_ha/fixtures/`.
  Suites: the pure
  `decide()` core (`crop-steering-engine/tests`), the lean harness, integration calc helpers
  (`tests/test_calculations.py`), the add-on **state-migration / in-place-upgrade** contract
  (`tests/test_state_migration.py`), and **version consistency** (`tests/test_version_consistency.py`).
  Any change to persisted state, add-on options, or entities needs a test proving an OLD install still loads.
- **Branches and pull requests:** follow `CONTRIBUTING.md`. **One change, one branch, one pull
  request, into `main`**, which releases are made from. Merge a pull request, or run the release
  command, only when the owner asks for that, each time, and never push to `main` yourself. Those
  are a person's decisions. Do not bundle unrelated fixes, do not reformat what you did not change, and
  never change a version number: only `scripts/release.py` does. Each pull request writes its own
  notes under **Unreleased** in `CHANGELOG.md`, `addons/f2_control/CHANGELOG.md` and `WHATS_NEW.md`.
  A feature that crosses layers is built as one commit per layer. Generated files (the dashboard
  bundle, the vendored engine copy) change only together with their source; CI proves they match.
- **Releasing:** follow `docs/RELEASING.md`. Once what is to be released is merged into `main`,
  `python scripts/release.py X.Y.Z` releases it when Validate has passed on it. The script dates the Unreleased notes, sets the one version number
  (`manifest.json`, `const.py`, the app's `config.yaml`, the README badge), commits, tags, pushes
  and publishes the GitHub release on this repository, whose rooms are the test.
  `--public` then fast-forwards `Chill-Division/HA-Irrigation-Strategy`'s `main` to that same
  tagged commit and publishes the release there, for everyone else. Between releases, `--sync` takes
  merged commits that ship nothing (README, docs, pictures, scripts, tests) to that `main` with no
  release; anything under `custom_components/` or `addons/f2_control/` waits for one. `--dry-run`
  changes nothing.
  The controller is built on each box from the branch it tracks, so **a push that changes
  `version:` on `main` IS a release** of the part that drives the pump, and a controller built
  between releases (a fresh install, a Rebuild) builds what is merged on `main` then, under the last
  released number: merge close to releasing. A version number is never reused for a different
  release; a bad one is never made public, and its fix takes the next number.
- **Deploying changes:** release both halves together with `scripts/release.py`. The
  controller app is installed only from this repository
  (`addons/f2_control`); the old `JakeTheRabbit/f2-control` mirror is retired and gets
  nothing. Existing app installations update in place to preserve their Supervisor
  identity and `/data`; one still installed from the mirror moves once, carrying
  `/data/state.json` and its options (`docs/INSTALL.md`). A plain restart
  does not change a baked controller image. Use Supervisor Update for a published
  release (or Rebuild for local source), then verify the running image and modules.
  Restart HA after integration updates; see `docs/INSTALL.md` for the current path.
- **Commit style:** conventional commits (`feat:`/`fix:`/`docs:`/`chore:`) with a
  `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer when written via Claude Code. One long-lived branch, `main`;
  everything else is a short-lived proposal branched from it, deleted once its pull request is
  merged or closed.
- **Changelog = dual view.** Every release in `CHANGELOG.md` leads with what changed, in words anyone
  can follow and under no heading of its own, then **🔧 Technical notes** (entity/code detail). Each
  pull request adds its lines to both, under `## [Unreleased]`.
- **What's new = for growers.** A change a grower would notice also adds one line under
  `## Unreleased` in `custom_components/crop_steering/WHATS_NEW.md`, which the dashboard shows once
  after an update: plain words (what they can now do or see, not how), with no entity ids, error
  codes, file names or pull request numbers. At most five lines a release, the small things as one
  last line, "Bug fixes and improvements." The release notes keep the detail; the window links to
  them. `tests/test_whats_new.py` holds each release's section to those rules.

## Compatibility & data — never break a live install

This system is live-installed on many boxes, old and new. Every change must upgrade them
**transparently in place** AND work **zero-setup** on a fresh install. Do not tailor a change
to one facility and break others.

**State & storage.** The add-on persists per-zone runtime state to **`/data/state.json`**
(HA-managed, **non-ephemeral** — survives restart and Rebuild): phase, peak VWC, shot/daily
counters, EC offset/integral, timestamps. Writes are atomic (`tmp` + `os.replace`).
`/data/options.json` holds the user's add-on config (HA-managed). The engine keeps **no
database** and writes nothing outside `/data`; the integration stores its config in the HA
config entry. There is no schema to migrate by hand.

**In-place upgrade (mandatory).**
- `Controller._load_state` already tolerates a missing file, corrupt JSON, missing keys,
  unknown legacy keys, bad timestamps, and zones absent from the file (they seed fresh).
  **Keep it that way.** Adding a state field → add it to `_fresh_zone` with a safe default and
  read it with `.get(k)` / `is not None`; never assume it exists in an old file.
- Adding an add-on option → give it a neutral default and read it `o.get("key", default)` so an
  old `options.json` without the key still works. Never require the operator to wipe state,
  re-run setup, reconfigure, or hand-migrate a schema.
- Integration entity changes → additive. Renaming/removing an entity an old install relies on
  is breaking; avoid or migrate.

**Fresh install (mandatory).** Works with no extra layers — no manual DB/schema step, no
required post-install migration. Defaults sane out of the box.

**Stay generic.** Site values are **defaults or overrides, never hardcoded assumptions**: entity ids,
plant counts, block sizes, dripper flow, lights hours. A change that only works because of one site's
exact names or numbers is a bug. The add-on's `substrate_l` / `flow_lps` default to generic placeholders
(5 L / 0.02 L/s). (The source-water gate and its `feed_ec_sensor` / `feed_ph_sensor` options were
removed in 2.26.0.)

**Prove it.** `tests/test_state_migration.py` locks the backward-compatible load and
`tests/test_version_consistency.py` keeps versions aligned. Run `bash tests/run_ci.sh`; detail
in `docs/TESTING.md`. A change to state/options/entities isn't done until a test shows an old
install still loads.

## Operational verification

- Preserve current live setpoints, mapping, enable flags, app options and persistent
  controller state before updating. Historical facility examples are not live truth.
- Verify installed versions, running module hashes, integration entry state,
  controller heartbeat, and restored settings after activation. A copied file or
  successful restart alone does not prove a software update.
- Verify physical delivery separately. Pump or valve ON history shows an electrical
  state; only independent flow measurement or a catch test proves delivered water.
- Shot sizing uses both zone-total substrate and zone-total dripper flow, derived
  from per-plant pot size, plant count and drippers. Keep the units explicit.
